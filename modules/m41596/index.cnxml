  <md:title>Interactive Case Study Simulations in Educational Leadership</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Simulations are presented that are interactive and use video clips to present problem scenarios that are followed by decision-making or discussion opportunities for students. In this online set of simulations are three case studies of typical administrative problems that school leaders and teachers might encounter. The topics for the three cases involve the following: a) a studentâ€™s walkman-type radio is stolen from him on a school bus; b) some teachers complain to the principal about another teacher who is consistently late in picking up her students; c) one special education student and one regular student in an inclusive classroom get into a fight with a variety of different versions of the fight presented--each of which leads to different problem solving opportunities. In addition, there is a manual that suggests ways in which professors and students may use the simulations, and the manual also provides an overview of decision making theory for students to review.</md:abstract>

</list><para id="delete_me">These simulations will work on both Macintosh and PC computer types. No special software or hardware is needed to use these simulations. The three simulations were developed for a class at Florida Gulf Coast University by professor Thomas Valesky. They can be used by a professor in either a large class setting or with small groups of students in cooperative learning groups. It is recommended that professors supplement the discussion questions that are posted in the simulations with questions and discussion items that are of local importance in your state and local school districts.</para><para id="element-861"><link url="http://coe.fgcu.edu/faculty/valesky/edleadsims/simulations.html">CLICK HERE</link> or go to http://coe.fgcu.edu/faculty/valesky/edleadsims/simulations.html to access and use Thomas Valesky's interactive case study simulations.
